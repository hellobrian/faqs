## Q: Should I be doing web or app development? 

## A: Web development. 

I'm biased. I'm already doing lots of web development and this space has been the most interesting for me because it's the most accessible to learn and build with. I also think that web technologies have grown enough to where you can create great iOS/Android apps with JavaScript and web technologies. The bottom line for me is aligning with the following: 
* What do you want to build? 
* What do you love to build with? 

## Q: Is it the right choice to become a developer? Like, will there still be jobs and stuff?

## A: Yes there will be jobs. But is it right for you? Hopefully, yes!

For me, I didn't really know if web development was right for me until I tried it.
But it's likely that this craft appeals to you because you're creative, smart, fun, whatever.

## A: It Depends...
