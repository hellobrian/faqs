Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: Should I be doing web or app development? 

## A: Web development. 

I'm biased. I'm already doing lots of web development and this space has been the most interesting for me because it's the most accessible to learn and build with. I also think that web technologies have grown enough to where you can create great iOS/Android apps with JavaScript and web technologies. The bottom line for me is aligning with the following: 
* What do you want to build? 
* What do you love to build with? 

## Q: Is it the right choice to become a developer? Like, will there still be jobs and stuff?

## A: Yes there will be jobs. But is it right for you? Hopefully, yes!

For me, I didn't really know if web development was right for me until I tried it.
But it's likely that this craft appeals to you because you're creative, smart, fun, <insert more ways I would genuinely compliment your human-ness>.

The bottom line for me was: give "coding" a fair shot; really get deep in it to see if I genuinely like "coding".
And I say "coding" because I didn't trust that I would really understand what that term meant until I started doing more of it.
Now I can say that "coding" isn't just "coding". 

## Q: Is it worth doing [Bitmaker Labs](https://bitmakerlabs.com/)? 

I get this question a lot and it's a question that shouldn't be taken too lightly. 

The real question that I'm being asked is this: 

"Is it worth the time and money to take a "coding bootcamp" to learn web development full-time for a few months?

## A: It Depends...

Most people I know are college undergrads. The next thing they do is either:
* Get a job
* Get a masters in order to get a job

I think a lot of people are trying to get a job and coding bootcamps look awesome for doing that.
Getting a job was my goal with Bitmaker Labs and that's totally fine. 
I knew that I did not want to get a masters degree because the time and $$$ commitment wasn't really within my reach.
But I was privelaged enough to afford $10K and 3 months of not working in Toronto to do Bitmaker Labs -- this is definitely a privelage and it's not for everyone. 

But here's the thing: 

Technically, you don't need Bitmaker Labs (but it's definitely nice to go).

### What you can do without Bitmaker Labs

As long as you have the internet, you can use the internet to learn how to internet. 
There are so many to learn programming, software development and design online that are cheap or free.

I used a lot of codeschool before and during Bitmaker Labs. 
Today, I'm still using a lot of codeschool courses to keep up-to-date with technologies I'm using at work.

### A checklist for identifying your choice to pursue software development
- [ ] Do you like coding? (yes/no/idk yet)
- [ ] Ignoring the many times you wanted to punch your computer screen in the face, did it feel fucking awesome when you solved that thing you were trying to solve? (yes/no/idk yet)
